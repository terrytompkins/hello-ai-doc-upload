Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience, without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:
- Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled training data
- Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in data without labels
- Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment
- Deep Learning: Using neural networks with multiple layers

Applications of AI and ML include:
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Medical Diagnosis
- Financial Trading

The field continues to evolve rapidly, with new breakthroughs in areas like large language models, computer vision, and robotics.
